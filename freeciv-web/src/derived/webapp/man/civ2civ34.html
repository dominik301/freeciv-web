A Granary also halves the food wasted in cities far from your capital. Together with a Courthouse it eliminates food waste.

This increase in shield production may contribute significantly to pollution; a Manufacturing Plant also increases the pollution caused by the population of the city.

<td>Makes a city the capital and the center of your government. Waste in other cities (corruption, production waste, and food waste) is often related to how far away from the capital they are. On top of this, corruption and production waste in your capital itself is half of what it would otherwise be (and a Courthouse will eliminate it entirely).

The cost to enemy Diplomats and Spies of inciting a revolt in a city also depends upon the city's distance from the capital (under all forms of government). Your capital city itself cannot be incited to revolt, and enjoys a bonus when enemy agents try to evade your own agents stationed in the city, or sabotage your buildings.

Take good care of your capital, as its loss may result in your empire plunging into civil war. Losing your current palace also results in losing whatever spaceship you might have.

If the capital is in a dangerous location, or a more central capital would give a better corruption distribution, you can move your palace by rebuilding it in another city.

Under Despotism the city containing the palace gains a +75% gold bonus, and under Monarchy a +50% gold bonus.
