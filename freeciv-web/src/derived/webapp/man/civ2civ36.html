<h3 class='section'>Anarchy</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Anarchy is simply the absence of any recognizable government. Citizens are disorganized and unproductive, and will spend all income as quickly as possible, rather than paying taxes or conducting research.

* Buildings and technologies do not require any upkeep.
* Each worked tile that gives more than 2 Food, Shield, or Trade will suffer a -1 penalty, unless the city working it is celebrating. (Cities below size 3 will not celebrate.)
* Each city can support up to 2 units for free; further units each cost 1 shield per turn.
* Military units do not cause unhappiness even when deployed aggressively.
* Military units impose martial law. Up to 3 military units inside a city will each force 1 unhappy citizen to become content.
* You have no control over tax rates. All trade income is converted to luxuries.
* Half of the luxuries, including those converted from other trade income, are wasted.
* Conventional corruption increases with distance from the capital (half as fast with knowledge of The Corporation).
* Base production waste is 30%. This increases with distance from the capital (half as fast with knowledge of Trade).

Features:
* If you lose your capital, the base chance of civil war is 99%.

<h3 class='section'>Tribal</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Under a Tribal government, you are part ruler of your people. Your control over your citizens is maintained largely by spiritual counsel.

Compared to Despotism, a Tribal economy is more shield-oriented. Its bonuses to veterancy can be an advantage in wartime, but it lacks the martial law of other early governments.

* Increases by half the chance of land units getting the next veteran level after a battle.
* Each worked tile that gives more than 2 Food, Shield, or Trade will suffer a -1 penalty, unless the city working it is celebrating. (Cities below size 3 will not celebrate.)
* Each city gets 1 extra content citizen.
* Each city can support up to 2 units for free; further units each cost 1 shield per turn.
* Unlike later governments, military units do not cause unhappiness even when deployed aggressively.
* Base corruption is 30% (the highest under any government). This increases with distance from the capital (half as fast with knowledge of The Corporation).
* There is no base level of production waste, but an increasing amount with distance from the capital (half as fast with knowledge of Trade).

Features:
* If you lose your capital, the base chance of civil war is 90%.
* You can have up to 12 cities before an additional unhappy citizen appears in each city due to civilization size.
* After the first unhappy citizen due to civilization size, for each 12 additional cities another unhappy citizen will appear.
* The maximum rate you can set for science, gold, or luxuries is 60%.

<h3 class='section'>Communism</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>A Communist government is based on the ideal that all people are equal.  All goods are owned by the state, rather than by private citizens.  Communism gives a balance between military and commercial styles of government.

<h3 class='section'>Fundamentalism</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Fundamentalism is a form of government organized around a central set of beliefs. The beliefs, usually religious in nature, form a rigid guideline for actions and reactions of both the rulers and the people.

In a fundamentalist society, the people and the rulers are entirely devoted to their beliefs, and are usually willing to die to preserve them.

Improvements that normally convert unhappy citizens to content citizens, produce `tithes' (gold) equivalent to the number of people they would convert, and require no maintenance.

Fundamentalism is a good government for maximizing gold, and its Fanatics are useful in wartime, but it has a heavy penalty to technological progress.

* Base science production is half that of other governments. (A Fundamentalist city with a Library produces as much science as a city under another government does alone.)
* Each city can support up to 2 units for free; further units each cost 2 gold per turn (except for Fanatics).
* Each city tolerates up to 2 aggressively deployed military units; each further unit causes 1 unhappy citizen.
* Base corruption is 15%. This increases with distance from the capital (half as fast with knowledge of The Corporation).
* Base production waste is 15%. This increases with distance from the capital (half as fast with knowledge of Trade).

Requires knowledge of the technology Theology.

Features:
* Allows Fanatics.
* If you lose your capital, the base chance of civil war is 60%.

* Each city can support up to 2 units for free; further units each cost 2 gold per turn.

<h3 class='section'>Republic</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Under a Republican government, citizens hold an election to select a representative who will govern them; since elected leaders must remain popular to remain in control, citizens are given a greater degree of freedom.  Citizens under the Republic become unhappy easily, but the self-sufficiency of your citizens allows high levels of trade.

* Each city tolerates a single aggressively deployed military unit; each further unit causes 1 unhappy citizen.
* Base corruption is 25%. This increases with distance from the capital (half as fast with knowledge of The Corporation).
* Base production waste is 5%. This increases with distance from the capital (half as fast with knowledge of Trade).
