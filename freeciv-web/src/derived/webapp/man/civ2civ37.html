Settlers are one of the key units in the game, as they are your main means of founding new cities.

Settlers can also perform the same terrain alterations as Workers.

TIP: optimal production of Settlers occurs in cities of at most size 4, or cities with a Granary of at most size 6.

Migrants can be used to transfer population to other cities, but may not found new cities. They can also perform the same terrain alterations as Workers.

TIP: Migrants can be a good alternative to Workers in overpopulated cities, as they benefit from free food upkeep.

This type of unit has its own veteran levels:

Veteran level      Power factor   Move bonus
--------------------------------------------
beginner                   100%        -    
seasoned                   150%        -    
senior                     175%        -    
expert                     200%        -    

Engineers are similar to Workers, but they work twice as fast, move twice as fast, and may gain experience from work enabling them to work even faster.

With knowledge of Fusion Power, Engineers may also perform more radical terrain transformations than Workers, Settlers, or Migrants, with the "transform" order. Examples include conversion of Tundra into Plains, or even Ocean into Swamp in some circumstances (when on board an ocean-going vessel, on a tile surrounded by sufficient existing land). See the Terrain Alterations section for more details.

Partisans are guerilla fighters who are experts at using the terrain to their advantage.

A number of Partisans are granted free when an enemy conquers your city -- they automatically assume defensive positions in the surrounding countryside -- but only under these conditions:
 - Guerilla Warfare must be known by at least one player.
 - At least three quarters of the citizens must have your nationality.
 - You must know about Communism and Gunpowder.
 - You must run either a Democracy or a Communist government.

Fundamentalist nations can maintain Fanatic units without having to pay any upkeep nor causing military unhappiness.  Instead, each unit reduces the population by 1.

Paratroopers are experts at airborne attacks. From a friendly city, airbase, or airstrip, Paratroopers who have not expended any movement points can paradrop directly to any tile in range, and be immediately ready to act there. (Beware dropping into unseen territory, as Paratroopers landing on a tile occupied by enemy units are easy targets!)

The Mechanized Infantry has the strongest inherent defensive strength of any land unit, and is very fast on roads and easy terrain, but it is hindered rather than helped by rough terrain (it cannot move into mountains, swamps, or jungles), and it is only available near the end of the technology tree.

Chariots are horse-pulled war wagons. They have a stronger attack than Horsemen, but their speed comes at a cost: they are more expensive to build, they cannot take advantage of terrain to defend themselves, they cannot move in rough terrain (mountains, swamps, and jungles) without roads, and they cannot be transported by sea using early ships (Triremes and Caravels).

Armors are motorized war wagons that are faster, stronger, and can take more damage than any mounted unit. However, they are less adaptable to very rough terrain (they cannot move into mountains, swamps, or jungles without roads), and unable to use less rough terrain to improve their defense.

Catapults are large rock-throwing machines of war. They are very strong attackers but equally weak defenders and will need an escort to be effective.

While powerful, Catapults (and their successors) are bulky and awkward; they require roads to move in rough terrain (mountains, swamps, and jungles), are difficult to defend, and are too big for early ships (Triremes and Caravels).

Bombers are specialized airborne units that may only attack ground targets, not other airborne units.

A Bomber's attack against units on land is a bombard attack; against units on water it has a regular attack.

As with other aircraft, Bombers lose 10% of their hitpoints for every turn not spent in a city, airstrip, or airbase, or on a Carrier.

A Helicopter's attack against units on land is a bombard attack; against units on water it has a regular attack.

Helicopters can also transport one military land unit; while most troops must load or unload in a city, airstrip, or airbase (and not in the field or onboard a Carrier), units specializing in mobility (Paratroopers, Alpine Troops, Marines, Partisans, and Fanatics) can embark or disembark at any time.

Unlike other aircraft, Helicopters are not required to return to a city, base, or Carrier to refuel after a set number of turns; however, care must be exercised, due to the health they lose every turn.

The Carrier is a mobile airport.

It can transport aircraft and military land units (not wheeled), although land units cannot always be transferred to and from Helicopters while onboard (see Helicopter help).

TIP:  Guard Carriers with a handful of fast-moving ships and a battleship, as losing a fully-equipped Carrier is VERY painful and expensive.

You can build Nuclear units when you have the required advance, and the Manhattan Project wonder has been built by any player. However, without further technology they cannot move on their own.

With Advanced Flight, all Nuclear units (including those already built) gain a range of 8 movement points, and Rocketry increases this to 16.

On impact, the blast will destroy any unit in an area 3 tiles wide (3x3 squares for rectangular grids), including friendly units. Any city within the blast area loses half its population, and land tiles within the blast area are subject to nuclear fallout.

Nuclear fallout reduces tile output and increases the risk of global nuclear winter; see the help on Fallout.

TIP:  You may be involved in a situation where you've invaded an enemy country en masse, but the enemy cities are too strong. Before using a Nuclear unit, assemble a gang of cleanup units next to the city and have them ready to fix the fallout on the same turn it occurs! This minimizes the chance of nuclear winter. Eco-friendly nukes!

This type of unit has its own veteran levels:

Veteran level      Power factor   Move bonus
--------------------------------------------
attaché                    100%        -    
secretary                  105%        -

A Diplomat is an official that carries your dispatches and is authorized to deal with foreign dignitaries. He may also undertake various covert operations with the intent of harming your opponents; Diplomats in your own cities defend them against such actions.

Many covert actions may be attempted even in peacetime, but the more aggressive actions will be discovered and cause diplomatic incidents, giving an excuse for the breaking of treaties by a Federation or Democracy, or a nuclear-armed regime otherwise restrained by the United Nations.

If a foreign unit is alone on a tile, you may attempt to bribe it with your Diplomat. By paying a sum of gold the unit will immediately become yours; the exact sum depends on the status of the unit and that of the civilization owning it. Bribery when not at war will cause a diplomatic incident.

Diplomats can also perform a number of actions in another player's city, although each Diplomat may attempt only one action. Most of these actions have a chance of failure. Also, any enemy Diplomats or Spies in the city will oppose hostile actions, as will the enemy Leader in games with leaders; in this case, either your unit or the defending unit will die (if you go up against the Leader you will always die). If the defending unit dies, you lose one movement point and may try again.

The actions available to Diplomats in a city are:

 - "Establish Embassy": This action always succeeds, and gives permanent contact with the city's owner, as well as intelligence on their tax rates and technology. Each player you have an embassy with that knows a technology reduces that technology's research cost to you.

 - "Investigate City": Your unit attempts to report detailed information about the city: its status, what buildings and units are within, and what it is currently producing. The unit is not consumed by this action.

 - "Sabotage City": Your unit attempts either to disrupt all the city's work so far towards its current project, or to destroy an existing building in the city, at random. Once built, Palaces and Wonders cannot be sabotaged, and attempts to sabotage City Walls or any building in a capital each halve the chance of success. Sabotage may only be attempted when openly at war.

 - "Steal Technology": Your unit attempts to learn the secrets of a random technology known to the city's owner but not to you. Technology may only be stolen once from a given enemy city by Diplomats. This action may be attempted even when not at war, but will cause a diplomatic incident.

 - "Incite a Revolt": In return for gold a foreign city will change allegiance and join your empire, bringing along all nearby units that call it home, but reducing its size by 1. Units in other cities remain in the enemy's control, but units outside cities are lost to both players. The exact sum depends on the status of the city and that of the civilization that owns it. It is not possible to incite a rebellion in a capital, or in any city with Courthouse. Incitement may be attempted in peacetime, but will cause a diplomatic incident.

In some game strategies, hordes of Diplomats can be used to wreak havoc on the enemy.  Little wonder that Diplomats are often viewed with suspicion and fear!

Diplomats built under Communist or Federation governments will start at the first veteran level (secretary).

The cost to bribe units or incite cities increases +50% for each 1000 culture points accumulated by the target player, up to +500% (as if the distance to the capital was 6 times lower) when the player reaches 10000 culture points.

A city gets +5% resistance in diplomatic fights against enemy agents for each 100 culture points, up to +50% when the city reaches 1000 culture points.

This type of unit has its own veteran levels:

Veteran level      Power factor   Move bonus
--------------------------------------------
informant                  100%        -    
handler                    105%        -    
agent                      110%        -    
spymaster                  115%        -    

A Spy is more skilled in the arts of espionage than her Diplomat predecessor.

She can perform all the functions of the Diplomat; refer to the Diplomat entry for more details. Unlike a Diplomat, a Spy may also survive an operation in a foreign city and become more experienced as a result. Spies are also more effective than Diplomats at defending cities against foreign Diplomats and Spies.

A Spy can also be used to:
 - sabotage an enemy unit (reducing its hit points to half), if it is alone on a tile and the players are at war;
 - poison the water supply of an enemy city (reducing the population by one);
 - steal specific technology (with a reduced chance of success);
 - steal further technologies from a city which has already been stolen from (although cities become more resistant each time they are stolen from);
 - sabotage predetermined city targets (with a reduced chance of success).

A Spy that survives the more aggressive actions (sabotage, theft, inciting rebellion, and poisoning) escapes to the safety of the nearest friendly city.

Spies built under Communist or Federation governments will start at the first veteran level (handler).

A Caravan carries goods or material for trading with other nations, or to help build wonders in your own cities.

Caravans cannot take advantage of maglevs, but may travel on the railroads that accompany them.

A Caravan sent to a foreign city (one not owned by an enemy) can establish a trade route. The route's ongoing revenue is doubled if the two cities involved are on different continents. Each city can support a maximum of two trade routes.

A Caravan sent to one of your own cities that is building a wonder can add 50 shields towards its production. If your city is not building a wonder, the Caravan can take no special action.

TIP:  You can stockpile a stack of Caravans in advance and bring them all into a city where you have started to build a wonder, and finish it in only one turn!

Explorers are brave individuals that are very useful for mapping unknown territory.

Explorers can also perform some actions in another player's city:

 - "Establish Embassy": This action always succeeds, and gives permanent contact with the city's owner, as well as intelligence on their tax rates and technology. Each player you have an embassy with that knows a technology reduces that technology's research cost to you.

 - "Investigate City": Your unit attempts to report detailed information about the city: its status, what buildings and units are within, and what it is currently producing. The unit is not consumed by this action.

One Barbarian Leader appears every time there is a barbarian uprising somewhere in the world.

When a Barbarian Leader is killed on a tile without any defending units, the ransom is paid, but only to land units and helicopters. Usually the ransom is 100 gold, but can be less if the barbarian has less money.
