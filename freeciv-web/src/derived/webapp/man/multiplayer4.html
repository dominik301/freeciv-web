<td>Makes a city the capital and the center of your government. Corruption and waste in other cities is related to how far away from the capital they are, except when the government is Democracy or Communism. On top of this, corruption and waste in your capital itself is half of what it would otherwise be (as if it had a Courthouse).

The cost to enemy Diplomats and Spies of inciting a revolt in a city also depends upon the city's distance from the capital (under all forms of government). Your capital city itself cannot be incited to revolt, and enjoys a bonus when enemy agents try to evade your own agents stationed in the city, or sabotage your buildings.

Take good care of your capital, as its loss may result in your empire plunging into civil war. Losing your current palace also results in losing whatever spaceship you might have.

If the capital is in a dangerous location, or a more central capital would give a better corruption distribution, you can move your palace by rebuilding it in another city.

Under Despotism the city containing the palace gains a +75% production bonus, and under Monarchy a +50% production bonus.

<td>Monotheism<br/>no Michelangelo's Chapel<br/><em>None</em></td>
<td>Counts as having a Cathedral in each of your cities on the same continent. This makes 3 unhappy citizens content in each city; however, it does not affect citizens made unhappy by military activity. The discovery of Theology increases the effect of a Cathedral, making an additional unhappy citizen content. The discovery of Communism lessens the effect of a Cathedral, reducing by one the number of unhappy citizens made content.

Requires knowledge of the technology Monotheism.
