<h3 class='section'>allowtake - Players that users are allowed to take</h3>

<pre>This should be a string of characters, each of which specifies a type
or status of a civilization (player).
Clients will only be permitted to take or observe those players which
match one of the specified letters. This only affects future uses of
the "take" or "observe" commands; it is not retroactive. The
characters and their meanings are:
    o,O = Global observer
    b   = Barbarian players
    d   = Dead players
    a,A = AI players
    h,H = Human players
The first description on this list which matches a player is the one
which applies. Thus 'd' does not include dead barbarians, 'a' does not
include dead AI players, and so on. Upper case letters apply before
the game has started, lower case letters afterwards.
Each character above may be followed by one of the following numbers
to allow or restrict the manner of connection:
(none) = Controller allowed, observers allowed, can displace
connections. (Displacing a connection means that you may take over a
player, even when another user already controls that player.)
     1 = Controller allowed, observers allowed, can't displace
connections;
     2 = Controller allowed, no observers allowed, can displace
connections;
     3 = Controller allowed, no observers allowed, can't displace
connections;
     4 = No controller allowed, observers allowed</pre>

a set of continents of approximately equivalent value (if possible).

on the 'best' continent if there is an odd number of players.

If the server cannot satisfy the requested setting due to there being
