<td>Radio<br/><em>None</em></td>
<td>Allows a city to produce veteran air units (including helicopters and missiles). Also, damaged air units (again, including helicopters) which stay in town for one full turn without moving are completely restored.

A city with an Airport can airlift an extra unit per turn. Airlifting  instantly transports the unit from one city to another and will use all of the unit's movement points. A unit must have some movement points left to be airlifted, and cannot carry cargo.

Two cities with Airports can airlift medium and heavy weight units once Advanced Flight and Fusion Power are discovered.

<tr><td><img src="b.palace.png"></td><td>Palace</td>
<td align="center"><b>70</b><br/>0</td>
<td>Masonry<br/><em>None</em></td>
<td>Makes a city the capital and the center of your government. Corruption in other cities is related to how far away from the capital they are, except when the government is Democracy or Communism. On top of this, corruption in your capital itself is half of what it would otherwise be (as if it had a Courthouse).

The cost to enemy Diplomats and Spies of inciting a revolt in a city also depends upon the city's distance from the capital (under all forms of government). Your capital city itself cannot be incited to revolt, and enjoys a bonus when enemy agents try to evade your own agents stationed in the city, or sabotage your buildings.

Take good care of your capital, as its loss may result in your empire plunging into civil war. Losing your current palace also results in losing whatever spaceship you might have.

If the capital is in a dangerous location, or a more central capital would give a better corruption distribution, you can move your palace by rebuilding it in another city.

Under Despotism the city containing the palace gains a +75% production bonus, and under Monarchy a +50% production bonus.
