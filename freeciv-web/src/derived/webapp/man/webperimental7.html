Settlers are one of the key units in the game, as they are your main means of founding new cities.

Settlers can also perform some of the same terrain alterations as Workers (but cannot build Airbases or Buoys).

Upkeep for Settlers is in food as well as production, and a Settler can die if its supporting city runs out of food. Settlers in a Republic or Democracy require twice as much food per turn.

Workers have the ability to improve terrain tiles. See the help on Terrain and Terrain Alterations for the effects of their actions.

Workers can build airbases and buoys, which Settlers cannot. Workers must be on board a ship to build buoys.

Engineers are similar to Workers, but they work twice as fast and move twice as fast. Engineers may also perform major terrain transformations which are beyond the capabilities of Workers and Settlers, such as converting Tundra into Desert, or even Ocean into Swamp in some circumstances (when on board an ocean-going vessel, on a tile surrounded by sufficient existing land). See the Terrain Alterations section for more details.

TIP 1:  Upgrade Workers to Engineers when possible, as Engineers require the same resources as ordinary Workers.

TIP 2:  If you manage to build Leonardo's Workshop, research Explosives before the Workshop becomes obsolete.  This way, your Workers units will be upgraded for free.

Partisans are guerilla fighters who are experts at using the terrain to their advantage.

A number of Partisans are granted free when an enemy conquers your city -- they automatically assume defensive positions in the surrounding countryside -- but only under these conditions:
 - Guerilla Warfare must be known by at least one player.
 - You must be the player who originally built the city.
 - You must know about Communism and Gunpowder.
 - You must run either a Democracy or a Communist government.

Paratroopers are experts at airborne attacks. From a friendly city or airbase, Paratroopers who have not expended any movement points can paradrop directly to any tile in range, and be immediately ready to act there. (Beware dropping into unseen territory, as Paratroopers landing on a tile occupied by enemy units are easy targets!)

The Helicopter is a very powerful unit, as it can both fly and conquer cities.  Care must be exercised, because Helicopters lose a small amount of health for every turn not spent in a city or airbase or on a Carrier, unless you have the United Nations wonder, and Helicopters may be attacked by ground units.

You can build Nuclear units when you have the required advance, and the Manhattan Project wonder has been built by any player.

On impact, the blast will destroy any unit in an area 3 tiles wide (3x3 squares for rectangular grids), including friendly units. Any city within the blast area loses half its population, and land tiles within the blast area are subject to nuclear fallout.

Nuclear fallout reduces tile output and increases the risk of global nuclear winter; see the help on Fallout.

TIP 1:  Nuking the ocean will not generate fallout, and is a most effective (but expensive!!) way of getting rid of enemy ships.

TIP 2:  You may be involved in a situation where you've invaded an enemy country en masse, but the enemy cities are too strong. Before using a Nuclear unit, assemble a gang of Settlers, Workers, and/or Engineers next to the city and have them ready to fix the fallout on the same turn it occurs!  This minimizes the chance of nuclear winter.  Eco-friendly nukes!

This type of unit has its own veteran levels:

Veteran level      Power factor   Move bonus
--------------------------------------------
attaché                    100%        -    
secretary                  105%        -    
envoy                      110%        -    
ambassador                 115%        -    

A Diplomat is an official that carries your dispatches and is authorized to deal with foreign dignitaries. He may also undertake various covert operations with the intent of harming your opponents; Diplomats in your own cities defend them against such actions.

Many covert actions may be attempted even in peacetime, but the more aggressive actions will be discovered and cause diplomatic incidents, which can allow Republics and Democracies to break treaties.

If a foreign unit is alone on a tile, you may attempt to bribe it with your Diplomat. By paying a sum of gold the unit will immediately become yours; the exact sum depends on the status of the unit and that of the civilization owning it. However, units belonging to Democratic governments cannot be bribed. Bribery when not at war will cause a diplomatic incident.

Diplomats can also perform a number of actions in another player's city, although each Diplomat may attempt only one action. Most of these actions have a chance of failure. Also, any enemy Diplomats or Spies in the city will oppose hostile actions, as will the enemy Leader in games with leaders; in this case, either your unit or the defending unit will die (if you go up against the Leader you will always die). If the defending unit dies, you lose one movement point and may try again.

The actions available to Diplomats in a city are:

 - "Establish Embassy": This action always succeeds, and gives permanent contact with the city's owner, as well as intelligence on their tax rates and technology.

 - "Investigate City": Your unit attempts to report detailed information about the city: its status, what buildings and units are within, and what it is currently producing.

 - "Sabotage City": Your unit attempts either to disrupt all the city's work so far towards its current project, or to destroy an existing building in the city, at random. Once built, Palaces and Wonders cannot be sabotaged, and attempts to sabotage City Walls or any building in a capital each halve the chance of success. Sabotage may only be attempted when openly at war.

 - "Steal Technology": Your unit attempts to learn the secrets of a random technology known to the city's owner but not to you. Technology may only be stolen once from a given enemy city by Diplomats. This action may be attempted even when not at war, but will cause a diplomatic incident.

 - "Incite a Revolt": In return for gold a foreign city will change allegiance and join your empire, bringing along all nearby units that call it home, but reducing its size by 1. Units in other cities remain in the enemy's control, but units outside cities are lost to both players. The exact sum depends on the status of the city and that of the civilization that owns it. It is not possible to incite a rebellion in a capital, or in any city governed by a democracy. Incitement may be attempted in peacetime, but will cause a diplomatic incident.

In some game strategies, hordes of Diplomats can be used to wreak havoc on the enemy.  Little wonder that Diplomats are often viewed with suspicion and fear!

Diplomats built under a Communist government will start at the first veteran level (secretary).

Veteran level      Power factor   Move bonus
--------------------------------------------
informant                  100%        -    
handler                    105%        -    
agent                      110%        -    
spymaster                  115%        -    

A Spy is more skilled in the arts of espionage than her Diplomat predecessor.

She can perform all the functions of the Diplomat; refer to the Diplomat entry for more details. Unlike a Diplomat, a Spy may also survive an operation in a foreign city and become more experienced as a result. Spies are also more effective than Diplomats at defending cities against foreign Diplomats and Spies.

A Spy can also be used to:
 - sabotage an enemy unit (reducing its hit points to half), if it is alone on a tile and the players are at war;
 - poison the water supply of an enemy city (reducing the population by one);
 - steal specific technology (with a reduced chance of success);
 - steal further technologies from a city which has already been stolen from (although cities become more resistant each time they are stolen from);
 - sabotage predetermined city targets (with a reduced chance of success).

A Spy that survives the more aggressive actions (sabotage, theft, inciting rebellion, and poisoning) escapes to the safety of the nearest friendly city.

Spies built under a Communist government will start at the first veteran level (handler).

A Caravan carries goods or material for trading with distant cities and foreign countries, or to help build wonders in your cities.

Caravans can establish trade routes with your own cities or those of other nations (even enemies) by traveling to them. A route's ongoing revenue is doubled if the two cities involved are on different continents, and doubled again if the cities are from different civilizations. This last condition means the net benefit to your civilization of a trade route is the same regardless of whether you own both cities or only one of them; if you only own one city, trade in each city is doubled, but you only get the benefit from one end of the route.

Initially cities can support a maximum of two trade routes. Knowledge of the technologies Magnetism and The Corporation each increase this limit by one; knowing both allows cities to support four trade routes each.

Every Caravan that is used to build a wonder will add 50 shields towards the production of the wonder.

TIP:  You can stockpile a stack of Caravans in advance and bring them all into a city where you have started to build a wonder, and finish it in only one turn!

This is you. If you lose this unit, you lose the game. So don't.

Won't unleash barbarians from huts.

The Leader unit includes a court physician. The Leader unit can therefore be used to heal it self or other light weight land units. Healing restores up to 25% of the target unit's hit points. It costs one movement point for both the Leader and the patient. The unit being healed must be allied or domestic. It must be located at or adjacent to the Leader's tile.

The Leader unit includes a royal sapper. Using it has a 50% chance of destroying a visible building in an enemy
 city. Be careful! This ends the Leader's turn.

Can be converted to a Leader Yacht by performing the 'Deploy' action inside a city once Map Making has been discovered.

One Barbarian Leader appears every time there is a barbarian uprising somewhere in the world.

When a Barbarian Leader is killed on a tile without any defending units, the ransom is paid, but only to land units and helicopters. Usually the ransom is 100 gold, but can be less if the barbarian has less money.
